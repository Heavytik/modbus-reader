Demo project

This demo is not ready. It fullfilles only requirements for Long type numbers and partially Floats. Code quality is easy to improve.

Demo has done with Java Spring backend and React frontend.

Time requirements are tight. And please consider, that I haven't never programmed before with Java.

After that project, I think that it would be much more efficient to program with Python. There would be better support for "binary strings". And working with dynamic language would be easier when data is "unsupported number type". I researched different language options, but ended to Java, because I want to learn it more. Forehand I didnt found any significant advantage between languages (maybe a little bit in Python, because `int.from_bytes(bytes, byteorder, *, signed=False)` function)

After all, I think project would be doable with that my base.
